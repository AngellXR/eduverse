# So you want to add a file to the repo? 

It can feel a bit intimidating at first, especially for those who do not have a technical background. 

## You can add a new file in two ways. On the top right of this window, you can click *"add file"*

## This will give you 2 options: 
- [x] You can upload a pdf, or image, or folder. 
- [x] You can create a new note from scratch (keep in mind, you can add ".md" at the end to create a [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) file
- [ ] by the way you can add to-do's pretty easily too.
