# Enter the EduVerse Hackathon Planning 

We have been chatting async using [flipgrid](https://flipgrid.com/668a8a2a) 

### Requirements for experiences: 
- Cross platform 
- Device agnostic 
- Some association with history 

_Love explicitly calling out the first two. I actually think that’s something we could improve on from the last hackathon._

### Other callouts from Heather:
- heading into summer isn’t the best time 
- is a hackathon in September at schools return good timing?  
- can we establish monthly or every 2-3 week touch bases on the planning.
