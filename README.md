# Enter the EduVerse Hackathon Planning 

- We have been chatting async using [flipgrid](https://flipgrid.com/668a8a2a) 
- Our brainstorm was started in [Figjam](https://www.figma.com/file/TX7WYdWcIVsz9zfSsU55tF/EnterTheEduVerse-planning)
- Hackathon planning [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LnhxAMrmj5bwuEU0h7VMZAIg7UeeVQF3LimUGNbpigE/edit?usp=sharing)
- We can use any channels on the AngellXR discord. I encourage the team to pull in others from our community in the planning and execcution. 

## Requirements for experiences: 
- Cross platform 
- Device agnostic 
- Some association with history 

_Love explicitly calling out the first two. I actually think thatâ€™s something we could improve on from the last hackathon._

## Other callouts from Heather:
- heading into summer isnâ€™t the best time 
- is a hackathon in September at schools return good timing?  
- can we establish monthly or every 2-3 week touch bases on the planning. 



## A few quick tips: 
- To learn more about formatting notes like this, look into [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- If you want to expand on this readme, by all means please click "edit" in the top right. If you would prefer a GUI, you may visit the connected hackmd doc [here](https://hackmd.io/@mrmetaverse/eduverseHack) This doc is connected to the readme. 
- To discuss the eduverse hackathon on Github, please visit our [Github discussions](https://github.com/AngellXR/eduverse/discussions/2) section for the hackathon. Discussions are easily used to discuss any and everything related to the repo. I am testing the effectiveness of this strategy in long term. I believe practicing these documetnation habits will help accomodate for a variety of schedules, skillsets, and preferred tools. 
- These repos are able to hold links to any other docs or workspaces. So whether its figma or flipgrid, we can link to the places work is happening, and help close some of the gaps. Hopefully, this will help us measure progress, set the right goals, and grow. 
- If you want to create a quick note in this repo, click "Add File" and give your new note a name. If you end the name with ".md" it will format the doc as a markdown file. To learn more about markdown, please see the link above. 
- Work where you are most comfortable, just hook on your work here in the readme, or in a comment in discussions.ðŸ¥³

## Next steps 
- [x] Placeholder logo 
- [x] Placeholder site
- [x] Set up discord for eduverse (hackathon in angell discord, but we can leverage both with a objective of growing both communities) 
- [ ] What are we missing here? 
- [ ] Why is this hackathon important? 
- [ ] How do we want to promote this event? 
- [ ] Who are potential key partners? 
- [ ] What do we hope to achieve (objectives) 
- [ ] Things to avoid
- [ ] Begin documentation (establish some curriculum. Let's explore this deeper) 
- [ ] Review this readme, is there any information we could tell in a better way? How might we iterate on our documentation to ensure it is clear for all who join later? 


### notes from 05/28/21:

Largely community driven 
Accessible by anyone who wants to be part of that 
How might we ensure that the experiences have a place to live without going broke? Do we follow the showcasexr model?
